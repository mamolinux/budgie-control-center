  * network: Fix OWE settings.
    Enhanced Open (OWE) is not being saved properly from connection-editor.
    When we create a Wi-Fi connection using Enhanced Open (OWE) Security
    from nm-connection-editor and save it, it was not being saved and the
    security was being set as "None", with Wireless Security Setting
    being discarded. This is fixed by this commit. The fix is also being
    done in libnma (implementing OWE in libnma,
    https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libnma/-/issues/9), but this commit
    fixes meanwhile it gets ready.
    It was solved by adding treatment for the case in which owe was set.
    OWE is not treated anymore in the same case as None.

  * Port: Add individual app icons.
    This ensures that each panel has a usable symbolic icon. This also means that we don't have to rely on or worry about individual icon themes shipping (or not shipping) the icons that are needed for the panels, since it may no longer be guaranteed that they will exist in any given icon theme.

    of the ppd selection dialog. Fixes #1599, introduced with 179bda1b / MR: 1011.

  * network: Show configuration button only for active/connecting connections.
    In commit c7bd4428399588dc777cdca45f5f415f37cfec66 we started to
    show the configuration button for all rows, which fixes the original
    issue of not being able to tweak a connection during association but
    also introduces a regression of not having connection data to show
    for other connections in the list. This way, the configuration
    button will fail to create a net_connection_editor interface for
    rows that aren't associated with an active connection.
    Let's only show the configuration button when the NMActiveConnectionState
    is either NM_ACTIVE_CONNECTION_STATE_ACTIVATING or
    NM_ACTIVE_CONNECTION_STATE_ACTIVATED.
    Fixes #1494

  * applications: Set the Icon key in desktop file to a icon that exists While we dynamically append --symbolic to the icons while creating the sidebar model in https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-control-center/-/blob/master/shell/cc-shell-model.c#L270 There are automation tools (such as rpmdiff) that parse desktop files and verify whether their Icon= matches to an existing file in the icon theme package.
    preferences-desktop-apps doesn't exist in adwaita-icon-theme but
    preferences-desktop-apps-symbolic does.
  * Bump release version

  * version bump
  * Load keybindings installed by mutter Mutter also installs keybindings but to the GCC share folder. We need to read these as well as the keybindings in the BCC share folder. Closes #3

  [ Hui Wang ]
  * sound: clear the value on level_bar when stream is empty.
    We met an Input Device level_bar display issue on a machine which has
    no internal mic. At first there is no external mic plugged, so the
    Input Device list is empty and level_bar is gray color, after we plug
    an external mic, the level_bar has red color ripples, then we unplug
    the external mic, the Input Device list changes to empty and we
    expect the level_bar changes back to gray color, but some bars are
    still red color.
    Here clear the self->value to 0 if the stream is empty, then the
    level_bar will change back to gray color when Input/Output device
    list is empty.

  [ David Mohammed ]
  * Hide dynamic workspaces, limit number of workspaces to 8 Dynamic workspaces do not work under budgie.  Lets hide this from the UI rather than just deleting the code - this allows easier reinstatement if we subsequently want to reimplement this in budgie. Separately, limit the number of workspaces to budgie's 8 otherwise we get window manager crashes
  * Hide lock screen notifications, do not disturb notification Lock screen notifications are not applicable with budgie-screensaver Do not disturb is handled by raven, not here.

  * Add sound overdrive capability in the sound tab. This commit leverages the Ubuntu gnome-control-center patch to enable an option to allow > 100% volume.  Stripped from this patch is the restriction to only show for the Ubuntu desktop. References to 'ubuntu' have been switched to 'budgie'.
  * Add support for snap-store if installed to applications panel snap-store is a universal package installer. Some budgie-distros do not ship with gnome-software. Normally clicking an application allows users to open the application in gnome-software. With this patch, if snap-store is installed (and gnome-software is not installed) then the application can be optionally opened in snap-store. If both gnome-software and snap-store are not installed then the "open in software" button remains unavailable. . Patch taken from Ubuntu's G-C-C patching; its applicable to all budgie distros.

  * keyboard: For xkb options, have "Layout default" toggle, and "None" Meant to address issues mentioned in https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-control-center/-/issues/1214 using the solution proposed there.
    There is no "None" option for the compose key, since there doesn't
    appear to be a way to disable it on the unusual layouts where it's
    available by default.
    XKB options are a mess, but this seems like a more accurate
    representation of how they function.

  * Hide displays lock notification since this isnt applicable with budgie-screensaver
  * Display lock controls need to point to the displays panel We moved the lock controls to the more logical displays in and earlier commit.  This commit ensures the signals for the lock controls point to the displays panel to ensure the signals are created and function correctly.
  * Disable non working camera/microphones panels https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-control-center/issues/381 In short, these only kind of work for sandboxed apps and its questionable whether they work here either.  Ubuntu has disabled these. So we'll inherit this patch to equally prevent confusion what these options are for.
  * Add github templates
  * v0.3 testing release

  * Partial revert of gresource changes back to gnome gresources and their calls from c module files have to match where they don't we get either blank panels or segfaults This revert changes everything back to gnome - its no harm leaving at a value of gnome since resource files are not installed into locations conflicting with gnome-control-center

  * Budgify pkgconfig otherwise we overwrite gnome-control-center pkgconfig file

  * Add helper file to make releases Since this project uses git submodules, for distros that build from tarballs - the tarball must contain the source for this subprojects i.e. they cannot use a git tag. Thus we need to publish formally a release containing signed tarballs.
