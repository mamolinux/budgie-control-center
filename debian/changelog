  * printers: Set search button/entry as sensitive when printers list is empty.
    Currently, the search function is available when there are no printers. However, it does nothing.
    This commit set the search button and entry as sensitive.
    Fixes: https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-control-center/-/issues/2021

  [ David Mohammed ]
  * cc-window: Don't trigger main search when pressing CTRL+S CTRL+S is reserved for the "Save" action. HIG recommends to use CTRL+F to trigger search: https://developer.gnome.org/hig/reference/keyboard.html?highlight=Find.
    Since CTRL+F already triggers main search, this commit just removes the CTRL+S shortcut.

  * sound: Don't flip the balance and fade sliders in RTL.
    Fixes https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-control-center/-/issues/1067.

  [ David Mohammed ]
  * sound: Update sounds directory mtime when changing alert sound he libcanberra event-sound-cache that stores the resolved paths for sound names can get stuck with the fallback sound (bell) after trying to play an invalid symlink, such as can happen after updating to 43 which removed some sounds which might have been selected as alert sounds before.
    Neither changing the symlink nor touching the theme directory seems to
    invalidate that cache, but touching the sounds directory does.
    This now updates the sounds directory mtime before triggering purging
    the sound sample cache in the sound server via g-s-d so libcanberra will
    load the correct sounds when repopulating the sample cache afterwards.
  * sound: Add a "None" option to the alert chooser

  [ Dylan Van Assche ]
  * network: reapply connection on device.
    Changing an active connection applies the changes onto the
    NetworkManager connection, but not on the device. This is because
    NetworkManager clones the connection when it is applied on a device.
    This behavior is expected and documented in the NetworkManager
    documentation [1]. To effectively apply the connection changes onto a
    device, a reapply operation must be performed. This will make NetworkManager
    apply the new connection onto the active device without having to
    disable and re-enable the device.
    Perform this reapply operation when the Apply button is pressed in the
    Connection Editor so the changes effectively propagate to the network
    device.

  [ David Mohammed ]
  * network: add missing cancellable Add missing GCancellables to resolve the FIXME statements and avoid possible crashes if the properties in NetConnectionEditor outlive themselves.
  * network: Init editor when secrets are missing When NetworkManager doesn't give us any secrets for a connection, the connection editor still needs to be opened. This change ensures that initialization of the editor completes even when there's an error when fetching secrets.
  * network: Disable DNS entry if the automatic option is enabled

  [ Jan Pokorný ]
  * display: Add 32:9 to known aspect ratios.
    Resolution dropdown previously did not show an aspect ratio hint for
    32:9 resolutions. This adds the 32:9 aspect ratio to recognized ones.
    Fixes #2334

  [ Sundeep Anand ]
  * keyboard: country matches should not be shown under a language name.
    country_layouts are being appended to the layouts_with_locale which results in less relevant
    layout groupings. for example, we if choose Hindi language which is an Indian language,
    all Indian language layouts are shown within it - including Tamil, Bangla etc.
    furthermore, language_layouts are also getting appended for countries where they may not
    belong, for example, English (Ireland) is shown when we search India.
    The layouts_with_locale table is filled as union however it yields better
    search results if we change that to intersection.
    Relates #2114

  [ Zdenek Dohnal ]
  * printers: Use CUPS dest API for printing test page instead CUPS IPP API.
    The current usage of CUPS IPP API does not work for temporary queues, because the g-c-c sends the request without creating a local printer first, so the request is sent to non-existing printer.
    If you use the destination from cupsGetNamedDest() for printing, CUPS library does the local printer creation internally and printing test page will work even for temporary queues.
    Fixes https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2148481

  [ Nelson Benítez León ]
  * user-accounts: disallow commas in real name.
    Because real name is stored in the GECOS field of
    /etc/passwd, which is delimited by commas that
    cannot be escaped, the user's full name must not
    contain a comma. More info at:
    https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/accountsservice/accountsservice/issues/83
    Closes #888
  * user-accounts: close CcAvatarChooser before showing GtkFileChooser
    so that the first click on the FileChooser is not used to just
    close the CcAvatarChooser dialog.
    Close issue #2315

  [ Alessandro Bono ]
  * bluetooth: Return TRUE for state-set callback.
    From the documentation[1]: "The signal handler should return TRUE to
    prevent the default handler from running."
    [1] https://docs.gtk.org/gtk4/signal.Switch.state-set.html
  * thunderbold: Don't cast CcBoltPanel when cancelled.
    Otherwise we get a crash.

  [ David Mohammed ]
  * power: Label the main "battery" as UPS if that's what it is Change the label from "Battery" to "UPS" if the upower DisplayDevice is a UPS. This avoids confusions like: https://www.reddit.com/r/gnome/comments/11aws0q/battery_indicator_for_desktop_computer_seems/ https://askubuntu.com/questions/1344733/why-does-ubuntu-show-battery-and-charge-info-when-it-is-a-desktop-with-no-batter
    "
    Why does GNOME display a battery percentage ("Fully Charged") when I'm
    running a desktop computer without any battery?
    "
    followed by:
    "
    Ha! I figured it out[...]. I have my desktop plugged into a UPS
    "
  * usage: Fix confirmation dialog when clearing history When clearing file history, a dialog appears saying that all files will be permanently deleted. However, this isn't true. Only the recent files list will be cleared and the files will remain intact.
  * common: hostname-entry: Update hostname only after apply is clicked Since the entry already shows an apply button, update hostname only after the apply button is clicked.  It's not required to update hostname after every character change.

  [ velsinki ]
  * sound: Prevent duplicate sound device entries.
    For unknown reasons, GVC mixer control can sometimes signal a new
    device with the same id as one that was added before. This means that
    in `device_added_cb`, a duplicate entry with that id is created, in my
    case with a different name. However, the last one added is valid, but
    that one cannot be selected because all other logic in the sound panel
    assumes the first hit in `get_iter` is valid. This breaks sound input
    selection then.
    The fix is easy; only add a new list entry if none with that id exists.

  [ David Mohammed ]
  * Revert "common: hostname-entry: Update hostname only after apply is clicked"
    This reverts commit d8d52d01be0b29c358f3b38b2f9e1cab28c0fe62.

  [ Emilia Daria Majewska ]
  * display: Try snapping all the displays after a config change.
    This issue was originally addressed in !257 ("display snap after changes").
    However it only dealt with a two-monitor setup, so the user is still
    unable to rotate the middle display with three or more monitors.
    This commit tries to snap the displays until all are adjacent to
    another.
  * display: Remove the monitor argument for cc_display_config_snap_output.
    The function tries to snap all the outputs anyway,
    so might as well remove the unnecessary argument.
  * display: Removed the loop from the snapping function.
    In all my tests, the snapping algorithm was successful on the first pass.

  [ David Mohammed ]
  *  network: Increase maximum MTU value from 10000 to 65536 The maximum MTU value of 10000 is too low for USB Ethernet, which has a maximum (for Linux USB gadgets) of 15412 bytes (although the upper limit is the USB wMaxPacketSize which goes up to 4294967295 bytes):   linux/drivers/usb/gadget/function/u_ether.c:#define GETHER_MAX_MTU_SIZE 15412.
    Multiple Intel NICs can use an MTU of 16110 bytes:
      linux/drivers/net/ethernet/intel/e1000/e1000_hw.h:#define MAX_JUMBO_FRAME_SIZE         0x3F00
      linux/drivers/net/ethernet/intel/e1000e/defines.h:#define MAX_JUMBO_FRAME_SIZE    0x3F00
      linux/drivers/net/ethernet/intel/igbvf/defines.h:#define MAX_JUMBO_FRAME_SIZE         0x3F00
    The NetworkManager limit is 4294967295 bytes but this is unreasonable
    in a typical enivornment because of the memory required for packets of
    that size.
    The maximum IPv4 and IPv6 (without using Jumbograms) packet size is 65535
    bytes so increase the maximum MTU value to 65536 allow full size IP
    packets to be used.

  [ Nelson Benítez León ]
  * shell: avoid activating panel from an empty search.
    Avoid activating a panel when doing an empty search
    i.e. clicking ENTER without having entered
    any text in the search entry.
    We should do nothing in this case, we fixed it by
    detecting for this case when an activation happens
    when there's still no search results view in place.
    Closes #2119
  * shell: fix visibility check for rows and avoid empty searches.
    When pressing ENTER (i.e. activating) a search with no
    results ("No results found") the first Wifi panel was
    being activating, that's wrong because cc_panel_list_activate()
    should activate the first visible panel, but there are
    no visible panels at the moment (No results found page is shown)
    The problem was the visibility check in cc_panel_list_activate()
    was incomplete and so it wrongly thought panels were app visible.

  [ Eric Daigle ]
  * cc-printers-panel: don't show two Add Printer buttons at once.
    As described in #1976, the printers panel shows two Add Printer buttons when the
    printers list is empty. Adds a check that sets the Add Printer button in the toolbar
    to be invisible when the empty-state page is shown (and thus the other Add Printer
    button is visible), creating a less confusing UI.
    Closes #1976

  [ David Mohammed ]
  * info-overview: show BUILD_ID in separate row Previously, if os-release included the BUILD_ID field, it was smushed into the OS Name row as follows:
        OS Name                    Endless OS 5.0.0; Build ID: 220810-230009
    This is unsightly in English; and in languages where the translations of
    "OS Name" and "Build ID" are long, the build ID may be ellipsised and
    hence useless:
        Nom du système   Endless OS 5.0.0 ; (identifiant de construction ...
        d'exploitation
    Instead, display the build ID in a separate row, and hide it if not
    present.
    Origin: upstream 50a92f110d30d8e0959b20d541431813a947625e
  * printers: Use the same sentence for "Add Printer" in button and empty-state Change the add printer button text, from the empty state section, to "Add Printer..." (previously was "Add a Printer...") so it gets consistent with the add printer button from the headerbar (in Printers panel) and with other buttons in Settings that end with ellipsis, such as the "Add Picture..." from the Appearance panel, which doesn't have the article also. Origin: upstream 53ff717b4dc8e43fa4815c2022985f96c68fb1b1

  [ Marek Kasik ]
  * printers: Show empty-state after removal of the last printer.
    Check whether the currently removed printer was last. Also
    check whether there are other printer being removed by CUPS
    right now (their amount is still part of self->num_dests).
    Do this check also in actualize_printers_list_cb() to catch
    corner cases from timing point of view. This will handle them
    with some delay if they show up.
    When undone, just check whether the number of printers is higher
    than 0 and show the printers-list page.
    Fixes #2023

  [ Matthias Clasen ]

  * datetime: Remove tzname_daylight.
    The code that set it could only ever have worked by luck in some
    timezones on some systems, and there's no API to obtain the information
    we were trying to store in it.  Nothing uses it, so there's no point
    trying to fix it.
    tzname_normal is also unused, but slightly useful for debugging, so
    rename it to tzname but otherwise keep it in place.

  * network: Fix saving passwords for non-wifi connections.
    When validating security settings for non-wifi connections, we
    temporarily create a wireless connection. Unfortunately, when this
    connection is destroyed, it'll clear the stored password from the 802.1x
    settings object.
    Avoid this by removing the setting before the temporary connection is
    destroyed. (Closes: #337)

  [ Robert Mader ]
  * display: Always show refresh rate.
    Refresh rates are an important information for users, even if they
    can't change them.
    This is especially true for cases where knowledge of the refresh
    rate may influence the decission about the resolution to use.
    Consider the example where a display may support `3840x2160@60Hz`
    and `2560x1440@144Hz`. When choosing `3840x2160` as resolution,
    the refresh rate will likely get hidden, making the user unaware
    of the fact that they will maybe not get what they want (potentially
    144Hz).
    So follow the example of e.g. the sound panel where input and output
    devices are listed in dropdowns, even if they are the only options
    selectable.
    Note: while this is a design change, for a big group of users this
    won't actually change the default experience as Mutter until recently
    had a bug to duplicate 60Hz modes in many cases. So most laptop users
    already saw the refresh rate panel in previous Gnome versions,
    dispite it having little use.

  * default-apps: switch away from deprecated function
    cc-default-apps-panel.c:101 uses g_pattern_match_string, which is now
    considered deprecated in Glib. It is better to use the 2.70+
    g_pattern_spec_match_string, which works as a drop-in replacement. This
    helps with function organization, as the original was created as a
    general Glib function while g_pattern_spec_match_string works under the
    PatternSpec module.
    This patch swaps the usage to the newer function, creating no functional
    difference and resolving a deprecated functions warning.
  * Update GLib dependency to 2.70.
    To support commit 9de5b003, the minimum GLib dependency level must be
    updated to 2.70 as that release introduced g_pattern_spec_match_string.
    This patch updates the GLib minimum required level in accordance.

  * network: prevent crash by disconnecting device.
    When a device is registered with add_wifi_device, a corresponding signal
    is registered for events. The associated remove_wifi_device clears the
    associated pages, but does not disconnect the signal. This causes the
    assertion NET_IS_DEVICE_WIFI to fail.
    This patch corrects this error, resolving #1889 as per the suggested fix
    from Benjamin (@bberg). 
  * network: fix line break issues.
    Commit 5e0fc5c1 ("network: prevent crash by disconnecting device")
    introduced two new line breaks after the final call of
    remove_wifi_device. Those line breaks are unnecessary, as pointed out by
    Robert (@robert.ancell). They should be removed for the MR to be merged.
    This patch removes those line breaks, which should allow for !1359 to be
    properly merged.

  * network: Fix OWE settings.
    Enhanced Open (OWE) is not being saved properly from connection-editor.
    When we create a Wi-Fi connection using Enhanced Open (OWE) Security
    from nm-connection-editor and save it, it was not being saved and the
    security was being set as "None", with Wireless Security Setting
    being discarded. This is fixed by this commit. The fix is also being
    done in libnma (implementing OWE in libnma,
    https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libnma/-/issues/9), but this commit
    fixes meanwhile it gets ready.
    It was solved by adding treatment for the case in which owe was set.
    OWE is not treated anymore in the same case as None.

  * network: Show configuration button only for active/connecting connections.
    In commit c7bd4428399588dc777cdca45f5f415f37cfec66 we started to
    show the configuration button for all rows, which fixes the original
    issue of not being able to tweak a connection during association but
    also introduces a regression of not having connection data to show
    for other connections in the list. This way, the configuration
    button will fail to create a net_connection_editor interface for
    rows that aren't associated with an active connection.
    Let's only show the configuration button when the NMActiveConnectionState
    is either NM_ACTIVE_CONNECTION_STATE_ACTIVATING or
    NM_ACTIVE_CONNECTION_STATE_ACTIVATED.
    Fixes #1494

    We met an Input Device level_bar display issue on a machine which has

    Input Device list is empty and level_bar is gray color, after we plug
    an external mic, the level_bar has red color ripples, then we unplug
    the external mic, the Input Device list changes to empty and we
    expect the level_bar changes back to gray color, but some bars are
    still red color.
    Here clear the self->value to 0 if the stream is empty, then the
    level_bar will change back to gray color when Input/Output device
    list is empty.
