budgie-control-center (0.2) stable; urgency=medium

  [ David Mohammed ]
  * Partial revert of gresource changes back to gnome gresources and their calls from c module files have to match where they don't we get either blank panels or segfaults This revert changes everything back to gnome - its no harm leaving at a value of gnome since resource files are not installed into locations conflicting with gnome-control-center

  [ Joshua Strobl ]
  * Merge in Display / Screen oriented privacy options into Displays itself.

  [ Marco Trevisan (Trevi√±o) ]
  * display: Support UI scaled logical monitor mode.
    When this mode is selected we need to assume that all the monitors are scaled
    by their scaling and the global UI scale.

  * Conditionally show fractional scaling row / expose functionality if schema exists.
    This ensures the option isn't exposed on operating systems which do not carry Mutter X11 xrandr fractional scaling patches. The only operating systems that do are Manjaro and Ubuntu.
  * Enlarge OS logo in About / Details view.
  * Update to promote Budgie version.
    Requires BuddiesOfBudgie/budgie-desktop#6270dafa4f0dcfa508998d0f109e948834eaf152

  [ David Mohammed ]
  * Budgify pkgconfig otherwise we overwrite gnome-control-center pkgconfig file
  * v0.2 release info
  * Add helper file to make releases Since this project uses git submodules, for distros that build from tarballs - the tarball must contain the source for this subprojects i.e. they cannot use a git tag. Thus we need to publish formally a release containing signed tarballs.
